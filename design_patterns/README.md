# Introduction

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems
in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular
design problem in your code.<br>

# Classification of patterns

Design patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose.
The three main groups of patterns:
* **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

* **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

* **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
